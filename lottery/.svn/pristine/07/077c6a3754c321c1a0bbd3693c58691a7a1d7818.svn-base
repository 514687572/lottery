p1=EOS Lottery is a popular lottery website for the EOS main net. 
p2=EOS Lottery gives players the chance to win huge prizes by betting on the outcome of numbers generated from each newly generated EOS transaction hash. Winning numbers are generated from the latest transaction hash by Lottery software, with the last number from the end of the latest TX Hash representing the winning number.
If the last digit is a number, it will be considered as a valid number, if not, the next TxHash will be considered, until all 5 numbers are generated. An EOS TxHash is a 32-bit ID randomly generated by a sophisticated encryption algorithm and normally shown as a hex value. Our drawing process takes advantage of this truly random computation process to ensure its fairness and transparency.
